React Roadmap

=> Why to learn React?
 - hype, job, trend, build UI
 - makes easy to manage & build complex frontend

=> When should I learn React?
 - After mastering JavaScript
 - most project don't need react in initial phase

=> Why react was created?
 - Ghost message problem
 - State -> JS & UI -> DOM (Sync problem solution)
 - Khan Academy, Unplash adopted React

=> Don't learn React if:
 - if you don't know how JS works or DOM works

=> React learning process:
 - go in-depth (Babel, Fibre, Virtual DOM, Diff. Algo, Hydration)
 - by making projects (One topic at a time -> To-do, Calculator, Github API)

=> React is library
 - Framework vs Library

=> Topics to learn
 - core of React (State or UI manipulation, JSX)
 - Component Reusability
 - Reusing of components (props)
 - How to propagate change (hooks)

=> Additional Add on to React
 - Router (React don't have Router)
 - State management (React don't have state management)
   -- Redux, Redux toolkit, zustand, context API
 - class based component
   -- legacy code
 - BAAS Apps (Appwrite, Firebase, Superbase)
   -- social media clone, e-commerce app 

=> After React 
 - React is not a complete solution in most case
   -- no SEO, browser render of JS, no routing
